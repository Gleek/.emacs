My .emacs settings
==================
Includes ALL the packages installed from melpa.

There are better ways to include them, but I guess, I'm too lazy.

I use this repository merely to keep a backup of my settings and keeping my emacs settings on all systems synced.


TODO
---------

- Organize all the settings properly
- Maintain different files for all the settings
