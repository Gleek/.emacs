* My Emacs settings
Core components are in the ~core~ directory. They are loaded by ~init.el~

Uses ~use-package~ for package management. So cloning this repo and opening emacs should install all packages automatically.

I used exwm on my linux machine but have recently moved to MacOS so the exwm components are not maintained any further.

- ~init.el~ is the first to be loaded
- ~core/~ contains all packages and there configuration
- ~core/lang~ has language specific packages and configuration
- ~cache~ is the directory where I try to keep all temporary files created
- ~packages~ has all custom packages written by me or copy pasted from somewhere
- ~elpa~ has all the packages installed in emacs
- ~snippets~ has all the yasnippet snippets

** Usage
~git clone https://www.github.com/gleek/.emacs .emacs.d~
